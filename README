Hans Gronewold's Ray Tracer Use Manual:

-Configuring Main.cpp:
    ANTIALIAS is the square root of the rays shot into the scene per pixel
    RECURSION is the maximum number of reflections/refractions per ray
    MAX_DISTANCE is the maximum distance for a ray to travel
                 it is set greater then the scene's mathematical limits
    
-Scene.cpp
    the scenes are defined here.  
    there are two test scenes (as stated from proposal).
    you must switch the scenes by switching which one is commented out
    the image is rendered according to screen size on computer rendering is done

-User interface
    makefile included, runs in linux lab, run with ./raytracer
    dynamic percentage complete will print to standard output
    when finished the window will open with the rendered image
    this window should be the size of your current screen
    pressing the 'q'or'Q' keys or the window's 'x' button will exit
    resizing the window is allowed

-Mathematical Description
    for concurrent algorithm and some math see code documentation
    rays are shot from camera through a theoretical screen
    the color is accumulated from different types of lighting


p.s. unused old and complete vector and matrix classes are included
